# Agent Instructions

## Session Start
1. Read `CLAUDE.md`
2. Read `docs/MODULES.md` — find the 🔄 active module
3. Work only on that module's tasks in order

## Rules
- Never skip a module — they have dependencies
- Write migration SQL first, wait for human approval before running
- Mark tasks ✅ in MODULES.md as you complete them
- One task at a time
